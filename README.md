# Bank_root_Front

This repository is dedicated for the Front-end part of the **bank_root** project. 

## Instructions

Following the design of the bank account management API for BankRoot, your team is now in charge of developing the frontend in Angular that will consume this API.

The API catalog is available at this address: http://152.228.163.78:3000/api

For this, you will have to respect the basic notions of Angular, such as :

Components: The page is divided into reusable components.
Modules: The functionalities are organized in logical modules.
Services: Data are retrieved via services.
Templates: Views are created using templates.
Directives: Custom behaviors are added via directives.
Routing: Navigation between pages is managed through routing.
Observables: Data flows are managed through observables.
Dependency injection: Services are injected into components via dependency injection.
Forms: User data is managed via forms.
